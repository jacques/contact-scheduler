# Contact Scheduler

A system for scheduling times to reach out to folks regularly that takes into account my anxiety and other brain quirks.

Notes for when I create an actual README:

- Need to set up a proper shortcut for notifications to work. See https://github.com/nadavbar/node-win-shortcut
- Need to run `electron-rebuild` after `npm install`
